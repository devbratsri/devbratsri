### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Neural Networks and Compiler Optimization as part of my Comp. Eng. Graduate Program at NC State. Apart from that I'm also dabbling in learning personal finance!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about running! Running is my favorite activity and I'm kind-of a health freak.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have run a full marathon and will start preparing for my second marathon soon!
