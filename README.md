### Hi there 👋


- 🌱 I’m currently learning Neural Networks and Compiler Optimization as part of my Comp. Eng. Graduate Program at NC State. Apart from that I'm also dabbling in learning personal finance!
- 💬 Ask me about running! Running is my favorite activity and I'm kind-of a health freak.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have run a full marathon and will start preparing for my second marathon soon!
